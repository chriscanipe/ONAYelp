=======================

This is the start of a simple Leaflet map application loading data from the Yelp! API. The data.json file is simply the output from the API Console page: https://www.yelp.com/developers/api_console, and was created using the conference hotel address in the "Near" field.

Here's the full query: http://api.yelp.com/v2/search/?term=Bars&location=Hyatt Regency Century Plaza, Los Angeles, CA&sort=2&limit=20&actionlinks=true
